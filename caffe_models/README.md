We provide prototxt and reference results for our networks introduced in the original CVPR 16 paper: Volumetric and Multi-view CNNs for Object Classification on 3D Data. Original Caffe models and LMDB/HDF5 files used for evaluation can also be downloaded.

Notice: for most up-to-date Volumetric CNN models with better performance, please turn to our Torch implementations with batch normalization and spatial transformations.
