# Volumetric CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for Object Classification on 3D Data

[Teaser picture + MATLAB code to extract feature]

### Introduction
This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03265). Our paper will also appear as a CVPR 2016 spotlight (please refer to the arXiv one for most up-to-date results). In this repository, we release code, data for training Volumetric CNNs for object classification on 3D data. We also provide trained models and a MATLAB interface to extract 3D features from a binary volume.
